Aruidno Code (I recommend a MEGA2560) 
It's a bit harder to configure this code to work for arduino because usually with arduino LCD projects you would looking for data in real time rather than just using it as an object sensor
Extremely simple and easy to create
The main parts needed is an ultra-sonic sensor, LCD screen, and LEDs (LCD configurations will depend on brand)
